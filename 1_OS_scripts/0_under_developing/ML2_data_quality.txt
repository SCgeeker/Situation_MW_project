“Instructions

Most modern theories of decision making recognize the fact that decisions do not take place in a vacuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables can greatly impact the decision process. In order to facilitate our research on decision making we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically we are interested in whether you actually take the time to read the directions; if not, then some of our manipulations that rely on changes in the instructions will be ineffective. **So, in order to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the question below. Instead, simply check all four boxes and then press "continue" to proceed to the next screen. Thank you very much.**
