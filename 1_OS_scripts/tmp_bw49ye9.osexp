1,1,"A few had been astute enough to see a fine poet in Browning, and <br/>Elizabeth Barrett was one of them. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,2,"The young man with the lemon-colored gloves and long dark hair and <br/>high-strung, restless manner who had visited her in 1846 had been <br/>moved to write to her because she had praised his poetry.",y,Diff.,1,n
1,3,"She found the man even more to her liking than the verse, and it was <br/>not so very long-only the time between May, 1845 and September, 1846-<br/>before Robert Browning had stolen the poetess from the dour father <br/>who guarded her like a dragon (never wanting her to marry any man), <br/>and taken her with him to Italy and a new life.",y,Diff.,1,n
1,4,"One morning, soon after their nuptials, Elizabeth Browning thrust a <br/>manuscript into her husband’s pocket, and then scampered upstairs in <br/>a swift confusion to her room. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,5,"Written during the time of their courtship and love missives, it was <br/>a sonnet sequence on their love. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,6,"These poems were never intended by Mrs. Browning to be published, but<br/>her poet husband promptly declared that they must be. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,7,The Sonnets from the Portuguese was his suggested title—a title which<br/>might shroud the fact that they were personal. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,8,They were in his mind “the finest sonnets written in our language <br/>since Shakespeare’s.”,n,Diff.,1,n
1,9,"Sonnets from the Portuguese, in Browning’s opinion, was hardly more <br/>flattering to his wife than his opinion of most of her poetry. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,10,"A better poet than he, thought Browning, and the world at that time <br/>agreed with him.",n,Diff.,1,n
1,11,"He called her his “moon of poets,” as she considered him her sun.",n,Diff.,1,n
1,12,"She was a pure singer with a lovely lyrical tenderness, the best poet<br/>of her sex since Sappho. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,13,"Her Sonnets, in their autobiographical candor, in their fine <br/>restraint and fullness, reveal a woman’s secret soul as had no other <br/>poetry in our literature up to that time. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,14,Her lyrical mastery shines in many passages of her writings.,n,Diff.,1,n
1,15,Italy was a kind of promised terrain for Elizabeth Browning. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,16,"Living in Florence or in little villages in the summers, she drank in<br/> the sun of the south and warmth of her husband’s love, and blossomed <br/>in a life of precarious happiness for fifteen years. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,17,"In Italy she found friends, most of them cultured Americans.",n,Diff.,1,n
1,18,"Hawthorne saw the Browning's there: the New England thinker and essayist Margaret Fuller visited them.",y,Diff.,1,n
1,19,"The painter Story came, and the young sculptress Harriet Hosmer. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,20,"One caller records that Robert Browning was 'simple, natural, and <br/>playful,' and that Mrs. Browning was all 'genius and sensibility.'",y,Diff.,1,n
1,21,"Daytimes Browning walked forth with Elizabeth's little dog Flush, but<br/>he seldom could be lured from his home evenings. ",y,Diff.,1,n
1,22,"One privileged intruder, coming frequently at night to join the poets<br/>over hot chestnuts and mulled wine, found talk good and laughter plentiful.",y,Diff.,1,n
1,23,"During the third year of their stay in Italy, a son, Robert Weidemann<br/>Browning, was born.",n,Diff.,1,n
1,24,But through this happy life a strain of dark foreboding began to <br/>creep. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,25,"Elizabeth Browning’s father died unrelenting in his disavowal of her <br/>marriage, refusing to see her or to sanction any of his family to see her. ",n,Diff.,1,n
1,26,Three children all younger than her own boy were left to her by a <br/>dearly beloved sister who died. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,27,She drooped and pined a little and Browning shielded her from <br/>ordinary visitants. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,28,She had a sudden and alarming attack of indisposition but was not <br/>considered in any precariousness. ,n,Diff.,1,n
1,29,"One night, soon after, she awoke from a troubled slumber and, <br/>apparently with no idea that she was about to leave him, murmured in <br/>the tenderest fashion of her love for him, and in his arms her head <br/>drooped as though in a faint, but it was the end.",n,Diff.,1,n
1,30,"Profound and lasting was Browning's grief. “Looking back,” he said, “I see that we have been all the time walking over a torrent on a straw.”",y,Diff.,1,n

2,6,These jobs require a wide range of skills and abilities.,n,Easy,2,n
