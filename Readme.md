### 20201120

- Meeting after first replication of Pettijohn & Radvansky (2016)

- Second replication: Extra rewarding? Feedback the participants how many right answers they made during the experiment. 

- Reading time is the better measurement than the verb probe responses in the case we want to test the mind wanderings. Reading time could directly measure text difficulty. 

- Setup of mind wandering probe: visual vs. auditory; auditory probe may missed by participants; overlay. Myrthe will draw an example of visual probe. 

- (Exploration) Is there the relation of mind wandering proportions and comprehension accuracy?

- (Exploration) Impact of text fluency on participants' reading time and mind wandering proportions. 

- Funding issue: Myrthe will ask if the committee to support us collect more data. 

### 20201204

- Myrthe has topped up the Prolific compensate fee (500 EUR) before this meeting.

- Sau-chin revised the structure of scripts and data files.

- In the first replication, more than 80% of participants were not native English speakers. We have to checked how Prolific filter the participants' background. 

- Update the replication script: This version will feedback the true/false right after participants answered the comprehension question. 

- Hypothesis and design of Mind wandering studies:

> Participants will show less mind wanderings in the stories which they can not expect the event shift.

- What are the best settings of mind wandering probes: 

1. Not all stories require the mind wandering probe. 
2. A mind wandering probe better shows at one/two sentences prior to the end.

No agreement about how many mind wandering probes we will insert across 40 stories.
